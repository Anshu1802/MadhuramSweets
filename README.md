Hello this is my final year E-COMMERCE project with documentation and download steps are given below
1. Clone or download the project from Github and save it on your local machine.
2. Open the XAMPP installation directory and navigate to the "htdocs" folder (usually located at "C:\xampp\htdocs"). 
3. Copy the project folder and paste it inside the "htdocs" folder.
4. Launch XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL modules.
5. Open your web browser and go to "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/" to access the MySQL dashboard.
6. In the project folder, look for a file with a ".sql" extension (e.g., "my_project_db.sql").
7. Go to the "Import" tab in the MySQL dashboard, select the SQL file you found in step 6, and click "Go" to import the database.
8. If the import is successful, you will see a prompt confirming that the database was imported successfully.
9. Open your web browser and go to "http://localhost/<folder-name>" to start the project, where "<folder-name>" is the name of the project folder you copied to the "htdocs"Â directory.
